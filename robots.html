  <p1> Okay so today we worked with Arduino to turn in an LED light. Neha really helped me understand the positive and negative currents which made the project a whole lot easier. We executed both extensions: having two LEDs light up at once and using a button to close the circuit. </p1>
  <p2> YEET I loved this project . . . . :) </p2>
